# How to bind ASPxGridView with manually created columns to different data sources


<p>This example shows how to select and bind <strong>ASPxGridView</strong> to a data source at runtime. The page contains <strong>ASPxGridView</strong>, <strong>ASPxRadioButtonLis</strong><strong>t</strong> and three data sources (<strong>SqlDataSource</strong>). In design mode the grid doesn't have any column. You should add all columns manually by using an appropriate algorithm. We have created columns as this is done in selected data columns.  If a data source has insert, update or delete command, a command column will be appended to the grid.<br />
Grid's data source is changed by clicking list items.<i> Note </i><i>that the </i><strong><i>EnableViewState</i></strong><i> property is set to</i><strong><i> false</i></strong>. It is done to avoid exceptions on binding  the grid to another data source.</p><p>See also:<br />
